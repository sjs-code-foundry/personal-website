# Personal Portfolio Website Code
The inner workings of my personal portfolio website, featuring HTML, CSS & Javascript.
## Motivation
The object behind this site is to showcase my skills as a developer.  To this end I intend not only to create an attractive, functional and fast website that scales well across different platforms, resolutions and connection speeds, but offers a range of useful tools that I and others can use in my personal interests.

With that said, you can expect this project to become more and more advanced and polish as my skills improve.
